# Function 
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It runs only when you call it.

# How to declare and calll the function
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Arun!");
}

greet(); # calling the function





 # Key Points to Remember

Functions make code reusable and organized
Use descriptive function names (verbs work well)
Keep functions small and focused on one task
Always test your functions with different inputs
Use return to send values back from functions
Parameters are like variables that receive values when the function is called

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Forgetting to call the function (writing greet instead of greet())
Not returning values when needed
Creating functions that do too many things
Not handling edge cases (empty inputs, wrong types)
