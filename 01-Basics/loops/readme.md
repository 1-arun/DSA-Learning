ðŸ”š Final Tips:
Loop Type	Best For
for	Counting a specific number of times
while	Looping until a condition is false
do...while	Run at least once
for...of	Looping through arrays
for...in	Looping through object keys
forEach	Simple array processing

# Key Points to Remember - LOOPS ðŸ”„
# For Loops:

Use for loops when you know how many times to repeat
The syntax is: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
Always initialize your counter variable (usually i, j, k)
Make sure your condition will eventually become false to avoid infinite loops
Use descriptive variable names for complex loops (index, count instead of just i)
for...of is great for arrays, for...in is for objects
Break large loops into smaller functions when possible

# While Loops:

Use while loops when you don't know exact number of iterations
Always ensure the condition will change inside the loop
Initialize variables before the loop starts
Update the condition variable inside the loop body

# Loop Control:

Use break to exit a loop early
Use continue to skip current iteration and go to next
Avoid modifying the loop variable unexpectedly inside the loop
